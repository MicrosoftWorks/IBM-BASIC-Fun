# IBM-BASIC-Fun
So, here's a couple files from AI I generated to play around with on my 5150. This was a dope to think I could 'learn' from this... So, here's my failure on display for all to appreciate :D

Some bs I "did" this to run on the IBM 5150 (&amp;+etc.) that probably dpoesn't work &etc.) For IBM Cassette basic and beyond for the 5150 and beyond.
Labled as such, and beyond, I hope someone has some fun, and beyond

There's really n o reason other than yeah.

Thanks,
MicrosoftWorks
(etc.)
